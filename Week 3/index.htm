        <h2>I Will code for food.</h2>
        
        <P> This is the start of my portfolio. So far this thing is strictly in Html.
            As I progress in web programming hopefully i can make this thing way cooler.
            With splashy graphics and stuff. So I can wow potential female companions and employers with my awesome (or not so awesome skills)
        </p>
        <h3>I will also code for money.</h3>
<p2>I am a college student and i have been in school for a rediculously long time. I am tired of being a poor boy. 
    If you can help me out that would cool. Ideally a job that pays 6 ^100000 dollars per minute, but whatever you can donate would be great.
I accept Cash App, Venmo, Google Pay, Paypal, Bitcoin, Etherium, basically whatever way of sending money you can think of I'll find a way to accept it if you I might plan on
putting easy links on the page here as well as some future point in time.        </p1> 
        <h3>I will also code if you pay my rent.</h3>
        <p2>
            This is pretty self explanatory as well. If you could pay my rent for me that would sweet.
